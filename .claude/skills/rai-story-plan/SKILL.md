# Story Plan

## Purpose

Decompose a story into atomic executable tasks with dependencies, verification criteria, and a deterministic execution order.

## Mastery Levels (ShuHaRi)

- **Shu**: Decompose each story into atomic tasks with full verification criteria
- **Ha**: Adjust granularity based on complexity, parallelize when possible
- **Ri**: Custom planning patterns for specific stacks

## Context

**When to use:** After `/rai-story-design` has grounded integration decisions (or directly for simple stories).

**Prerequisite:** Design document at `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-design.md` (optional for simple stories).

**Inputs:** Story with acceptance criteria, design document (if exists).

## Steps

### PRIME (mandatory — do not skip)

Before starting Step 1, you MUST execute the PRIME protocol:

1. **Chain read**: Read story-design's learning record at `.raise/rai/learnings/rai-story-design/{work_id}/record.yaml`. Enrich story-design's record with `downstream: {plan_derivable: bool, tasks_clear: bool}`.
2. **Graph query**: Execute tier1 queries from this skill's metadata using `rai graph query`. If graph is unavailable, note and continue.
3. **Present**: Surface retrieved patterns as context. 0 results is valid — not a failure.

### Step 1: Verify Design

```bash
ls work/epics/e*/stories/{story_id}-design.md 2>/dev/null || echo "INFO: No design"
```

> **JIT**: Before verifying design completeness, query graph for complexity assessment patterns
> → `aspects/introspection.md § JIT Protocol`

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Design exists | Load and reference |
| No design + simple story | Continue |
| No design + complex story | Run `/rai-story-design` first |

<verification>
Design loaded or simple story confirmed.
</verification>

### Step 2: Decompose into Tasks

Divide story into atomic, individually verifiable tasks. One commit per task.

| Story Size | Tasks | Rationale |
|------------|:-----:|-----------|
| XS (1-2 SP) | 1-2 | Single-pass implementation |
| S (3-5 SP) | 2-3 | Avoid over-decomposition |
| M (5-8 SP) | 3-5 | Balance granularity and overhead |
| L (8+ SP) | 5-8 | Consider splitting the story |

**Per task:**
- Description, files to create/modify
- TDD cycle: RED (failing test) → GREEN (minimal code) → REFACTOR
- AC reference: link to `story.md` Gherkin scenario (if exists)
- Verification commands: use the **project-wide** command from `.raise/manifest.yaml` (`test_command`, `lint_command`, `type_check_command`). **Never use file-specific paths** (e.g. `pyright src/module/file.py`) — the project config already defines the correct scope including `tests/`. If manifest commands are absent, use language defaults (see `/rai-story-implement` Step 3).
- Size (XS/S/M/L) and dependencies

**Always include as final task:** Manual integration test — validate end-to-end with running software.

Each task is atomic and verifiable. Final integration test included.

### Step 3: Order & Dependencies

> **JIT**: Before ordering dependencies, query graph for risk-first ordering patterns
> → `aspects/introspection.md § JIT Protocol`

- Map dependencies (sequential vs parallel)
- Apply risk-first ordering (riskiest tasks early)
- Maximize parallelism where no mutual dependencies exist
- Verify no circular dependencies

<verification>
Execution order defined. Dependency graph is acyclic.
</verification>

### Step 4: Document Plan

Create `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-plan.md` with:
- Overview (story ID, size, date)
- Ordered task list with descriptions, files, verification, sizes, dependencies
- Execution order with rationale
- Risks and mitigations
- Duration tracking table (filled during implementation)

<verification>
Plan document complete and reviewable in <5 minutes.
</verification>

## Output

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| Implementation plan | `work/epics/e{N}-{name}/stories/s{N}.{M}-plan.md` |
| Next | `/rai-story-implement` |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Design verified or simple story confirmed
- [ ] Tasks are atomic (one commit each) and verifiable
- [ ] TDD cycle specified per task (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- [ ] Final manual integration test task included
- [ ] Dependencies mapped — no cycles
- [ ] Execution order follows risk-first approach
- [ ] NEVER over-decompose simple stories
- [ ] NEVER skip TDD guidance — tests define behavior
