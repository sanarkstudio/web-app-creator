# Bugfix Fix

## Purpose

Execute the planned fix tasks in strict TDD order: RED (failing regression test) → GREEN (minimal fix) → REFACTOR. Each task verified and committed independently.

## Mastery Levels (ShuHaRi)

- **Shu**: Follow plan tasks exactly, RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, run all 4 gates
- **Ha**: Combine related tasks when gates are stable
- **Ri**: Adaptive TDD (property tests, mutation testing)

## Context

**When to use:** After `/rai-bugfix-plan` has decomposed the fix into atomic tasks.

**When to skip:** Never — even if the fix seems trivial, follow the plan.

**Inputs:** Bug ID, `work/bugs/RAISE-{N}/plan.md` with atomic tasks.

**Expected state:** On bug branch. Plan artifact exists. All current gates pass.

## Steps

### Step 1: Execute Tasks in Order

Per task from `plan.md`:

1. **RED** — Write a failing test that defines expected behavior
2. **GREEN** — Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR** — Clean up while keeping tests green

**Run ALL four gates** (test + lint + format + type check) after each task. Resolve commands from `.raise/manifest.yaml` or use language defaults.

If verification fails: fix and re-verify (max 3 attempts before escalating).

### Step 2: Commit & Present

Per completed task:

1. Commit with the message from the plan
2. Present to the human: what was completed, files changed, verification results
3. Wait for acknowledgment before continuing

### Step 3: Iterate or Finalize

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| More tasks remain | Return to Step 1 |
| All tasks complete | Run full gate check, present summary |
| Task blocked | Document blocker, escalate to human |

<verification>
All tasks committed. All four gates pass. Bug no longer reproduces.
</verification>

<if-blocked>
3 attempts without fix → document partial state, create follow-up issue.
</if-blocked>

## Output

| Item | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| Code + commits | On bug branch |
| Next | `/rai-bugfix-review` |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] RED test written first (proves bug exists)
- [ ] GREEN fix is minimal (addresses root cause, not symptoms)
- [ ] All four gates pass after each task (test, lint, type check, format)
- [ ] Each task committed independently
- [ ] Human acknowledged each task before proceeding
- [ ] Bug no longer reproduces after fix
- [ ] NEVER skip the regression test — it's the proof
- [ ] NEVER fix symptoms — address the root cause from analysis
